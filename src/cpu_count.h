/**
 * @file cpu_count.h
 * @brief Portable helper to query available logical CPU count
 *
 * Provide a small helper used by the application to determine a sensible
 * default for thread pools and worker counts. The function returns a
 * conservative estimate (number of online processors) and falls back to
 * 1 when querying is not supported.
 *
 * Contract:
 *  - Returns an integer >= 1 representing the number of online CPUs.
 *  - On platforms where querying the CPU count fails, returns 1.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *   int n = get_cpu_count();
 *   int threads = max(1, n - 1); // keep one core free
 * @endcode
